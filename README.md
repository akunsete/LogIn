## 🔐Login System UI
A simple and modern login interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project focuses on creating a clean authentication UI with smooth interactions and basic client-side validation.
It is designed as a reusable login component that can be integrated into various web applications such as dashboards, productivity tools, or landing pages.
Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of DOM manipulation, form handling, localStorage, and user input validation in JavaScript.
